Vendomat
Technologies used: Procedural programming in C#, Visual Studio
A vending machine (vendomat) that is loaded with different product categories. The
machine processes sales orders, delivering products from the existing categories as
requested. A sales order may contain a request for one or more products in one or
more categories. A sales order can only be processed if the vendomat has all the
requested products (from all categories). The vendomat is supplied by adding 10
products to each available category. The storage capacity of the vendomat is large
enough so that the product stock of a category has no upper limit.
The project requirement was to determine how many sales orders could not be
processed and how many supplies were performed.
